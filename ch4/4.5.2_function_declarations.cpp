// FUNCTION DECLARATIONS
// all the information needed to call a function lies in the first line of its definition.
int square(int x)	// FUNCTION DEFINITION.
{
	// .. function body.
}

// we don't really need to look at the function body unless we're curious.
// C++ provides a way of supplying just the first line of the function which
// tells us how to call the function.
// EXAMPLE FUNCTION DECLARATIONS
int square(int x);	// FUNCTION DECLARATION - note the semicolon!!!

// If we want to use a function which is defined elsewhere we simply include it
#include <"filename.h">
